1. Read all the data files in.
2. Combine training set and test set.
3. Use "grep" function and regex to filter and keep features with "mean()" and "std()".
4. Alternate activity labels to human friendly names.
5. Update column names of the original variables.
6. Merge data into a single dataset.
7. Write to first output file.
8. Calculate what is the dimenson required for the new sub-total dataset.
9. Create a new dataset for sub-total output.
10. Iterate throught the previously merged dataset and calculate mean value of vectors.
